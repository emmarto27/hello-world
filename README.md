# hello-world
My first repository

Howdy!

My name is Emily. I've been a digital content writer in the travel and tourism industry for the past 6 years.

I'm looking to expand my skillset, grow as a writer, and branch into UX writing.

I joined GitHub because I'd like to learn more about software development and contribute microcopy to open source projects.

I'm excited to learn more and collaborate with other users.
